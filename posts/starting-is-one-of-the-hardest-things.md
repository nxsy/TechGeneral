    I guess after writing blog software, buying domains and certificates,
    setting up Route 53 and Elastic Load Balancing and Elastic Beanstalk, and
    implementing HSTS, I should start writing some content.

Just over six years ago I stopped posting regularly to my fairly long-lived
blog (apparently started in April 2003), and just under four years ago I
noticed it was not loading because the server it was on had broken somehow, and
I didn't care enough to put it back up.  (Astute readers will note how those
two dates are roughly a few months in to my last two job start dates...)

I've written a number of blog posts over the last few years, but I haven't
posted any of them.  I don't even have most of them anymore, although a few are
in the branches of git repos somewhere.  I'll try dig some of them up - one of
the things I enjoyed about my old blog was rereading what I was thinking about
at various times in the past.  (I guess I'll try get that back online.)

I've also written two different bits of blog software since then - since that's
what one does whenever one contemplates starting a blog up again (although, to
be fair, I also started setting up Wordpress and Tumblr blogs too).

The first used [Hyde](https://github.com/hyde/hyde), a static blog generation
tool (whose development seems to have halted a year ago).  The second is what
I'm using now - a collection of Flask modules and some glue code that
constitutes [gibe2](https://github.com/nxsy/gibe2), which I wrote just under a
year ago.  It uses Frozen-Flask to freeze a Flask app into an HTML tree that
can be served by any static web server.

Putting something out there - let alone a first pass, a beginning with some
implied commitment to continue - is quite scary.  In my career, I've tended to
be the joiner and sometimes the completer to a project, not the initiator.  I
find it easy to take something from where it is to where I think it should go,
and hard to imagine what should exist.

I should mention that I have succeeded in posting a bit to
[play.TechGeneral.org](http://play.techgeneral.org/) about the occasional
spurts of time I get to work on a little [D language](http://dlang.org/) OpenGL
someday-might-be-a-game.  The minimum expended effort there is a lot higher -
building a new feature or doing a major refactor, and then explaining it all
in a post - in fact the posts are sometimes a lot harder to put together than
the code, and the code is quite a bit further ahead than the posts now. It will
probably be very sporadic with posts mostly coinciding with my long weekends
and vacations.  (And, unsurprisingly, I've just finished up a vacation where I
finally got around to putting the final touches on this here blog.)

Connecting together starting up being scary and game programming: I've been
watching [Handmade Hero](http://handmadehero.org/) religiously since it
started (the first few on Youtube the day after, the last few live).  Talk
about being a tough thing to contemplate starting - one hour a day of writing a
game from scratch streaming to the public every weekday - every single little
mistake in your code and in your explanations there for people to pick apart
without any opportunity for editing.  And having ~1000 streamers in your first
few shows - no pressure!

That definitely put just putting together a few words a week with no implied
time-bound commitment into perspective, so here we are.

I stopped reading blogs roughly when I stopped caring about mine.  I hope to
find a few interesting people to follow. A few of my friends used to post,
albeit infrequently.  I hope I can convince them to do so again as well.
